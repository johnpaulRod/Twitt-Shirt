# Twitt-Shirt
A basic website to place a picture of a tweet onto a shirt ran using nodeJs.
please note this is webapp is janky af as i am extremly new to node js.
and also you dont have to go this route .. you can use normal html+php+apache combo wherein  a headless node server can run seperately which just severs the tweet image.

//Main node Packages used
 screenshot-tweet
 express-handelbars
